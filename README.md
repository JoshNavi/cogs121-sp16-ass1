### Heuristic Implementations:

###### Visibility of system status:

User sees `Click here to login with twitter` only when not logged in. On the other hand user only sees `Logout` button when logged in.

###### Match between system and the real world:
The system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.

###### User control and freedom:

Website has bright red `Cancel` button after clicking `Add a drink` or `Comment on this Drink` which allows user to undo decision to post.

###### Consistency and standards:
Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.

###### Error prevention:

Form to post a drink has dropdown menus for drink type which prevents users from typing in an invalid drink type which could cause errors.


###### Recognition rather than recall:

Buttons are unambiguous such as `Post a Drink` or `Comment on this Drink` so users know what actions they will be taking.

###### Flexibility and efficiency of use:
Accelerators -- unseen by the novice user -- may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.

###### Aesthetic and minimalist design:
Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.

###### Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors:

If a user tries to add a drink without entering a name for the drink, an error message telling the user that the name field is required appears.

###### Help and documentation:
Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.
